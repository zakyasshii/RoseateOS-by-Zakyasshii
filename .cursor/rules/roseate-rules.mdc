Blueprint for RoseateOS

1. App Concept Overview

**Powered by Flutter 

App Name: RoseateOS
Type: Offline-first, closed-source mobile productivity application for both Android and Ios (Prioritize android first)
Core Focus: Privacy, personalization, and self-optimization
Target Audience: Individuals looking for full control over their productivity workflows, with a strong emphasis on data security.

2. Core Features & Functionality

User Profile & Settings
Personalized profile with user information (name, age, etc.).
Options for customizing app settings.
Privacy-centric user data management (encrypted storage, no cloud-based syncing).
Rule: Ensure privacy by storing all data locally and not transmitting user info online.

Life Dashboard
Centralized hub displaying:
Daily Planner
Calendar & Event Reminder
Progress Meters (Goals, Targets)
Rule: Data must remain offline, and all user data must be loaded from local storage.

Seasonal UI Theme
The app’s theme changes automatically based on the date and time to reflect four seasonal aesthetic vibes of their own aesthethic colour combination representation (Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter).
Users can override the seasonal theme and manually set their preference in setting
Rule: The seasonal theme must adjust without causing lag, and the UI should adapt fluidly to system time.

Productivity Tools

Daily Planner & Calendar: Users can schedule tasks and events, with notifications (offline only).
To-Do List with Prioritization: Smart prioritization based on user’s habits and deadlines.
Upcoming Target Tracker: Automatically tracks and reminds users of upcoming goals or targets.
Goal Tracker: Visual progress meters to track progress on personal goals.
Financial Tracker: Helps users manage their budget offline.
Notes Center, Brain Dump, and Idea Vault: A personal storage area for all user thoughts and ideas.
Business Contact Book: For organizing and storing professional networking information.
Rule: Ensure all input and output data are encrypted and stored locally. All reminders and progress trackers should work without internet dependency.

Encrypted Data Storage

Ensure that all user content (notes, contacts, goals) is encrypted and stored locally, with strong encryption methods for data security.
Rule: Implement AES-256 encryption for data security.

3. User Flow

First Time Launch:
The app will ask the user to agree to the terms and conditions before proceeding (one-time).
User’s profile information is collected automatically and stored securely.
After agreeing to the terms and completing the profile setup, the user is taken to the main menu. If not, the app forced closed.
Rule: Ensure that the agreement and profile setup only occur once at the first launch.

Subsequent Launches:
Direct access to the Life Dashboard after successfully loading data from local storage.
Rule: No need for an internet connection after the first launch; everything works offline.

4. Privacy and Security

Privacy: Data is never uploaded to any server or cloud. All data is handled locally.
Encryption: AES-256 encryption for all stored data.
Offline-First: No data is transmitted over the network unless specified by the user (e.g., syncing preferences).
Rule: Data access is restricted by strong user authentication (PIN - optional and user can setup and toogle enable/disable in Setting where the next login requires PIN 6-digit password)

5. Backend Integration (Cursor AI)

User Profile: Cursor AI will handle the secure storage and encryption of the user profile data.
Data Storage: Cursor AI will manage local encrypted storage for all user-generated data (to-do list, goals, etc.).
Analytics: Cursor AI will help analyze user productivity data, providing insight into performance patterns (heatmaps, etc.).
Rule: Ensure that no personal data is transmitted over the network unless specifically needed for a feature like data backup (optional).

6. Frontend Design (v0.dev)

UI/UX Design: The app must be aesthetically pleasing, with smooth transitions between themes, data visualization tools (progress meters, heatmaps), and productivity tools.
Seasonal UI: Ensure fluid transitions between seasonal themes based on system time.
User Experience: The app should be lightweight and responsive, with no lag when switching between sections or interacting with the planner.
Rule: The app should adapt to different screen sizes and resolutions, ensuring compatibility with various Android and Ios devices.

# Cursor AI Rules

To guide Cursor AI in maintaining this blueprint, the following rules are proposed:

Data Privacy Rule: Ensure all user data is stored locally. Encrypt sensitive data using AES-256 encryption. No external communication unless necessary (e.g., optional backups).

UI Consistency Rule: Ensure the UI adapts smoothly to seasonal changes and offers a manual override for users.

Offline Functionality Rule: Ensure all functionalities (planner, notes, trackers) work fully offline, without needing an internet connection.

Data Security Rule: Implement AES-256 encryption for all stored data, and ensure that data is not accessible without user authentication.

Progress Tracking Rule: Implement automatic tracking and visual representation of user progress for goals, tasks, and finances.
